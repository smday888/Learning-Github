# Learning-Github
Documentation of my experience with the github welcome tutorial.

I have made it this far - editing a version of my readme document in a branch of the master branch of this repository. 

Initial confusion: I thought I named this branch readme-edits, but here I see I am editing something called readme.md. Is the .md a standard extension for branches? I suppose this will become clear as I continue to work on this.

Thus far I have learned that:
1. Each "project" requires the creation of a "repository".
2. Each repository has a "master branch" and potentially many other "branches" that or may not eventually be merged with the master branch to effectively modify the repository.
3. Each branch that is eventually "committed" should (must?) include a description of the changes made, the reasons for these changes, etc.

I notice that an automatic numbering editor took over in the above list. I wonder what other editing capabilities this basic editor has. I will learn.
